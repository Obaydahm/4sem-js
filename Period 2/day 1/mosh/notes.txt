How to, dynamically, 
assign a port number via an environment variable:
Reason for using env var:
On prod environment, the port is dynamically assigned by the
hosting environment,
and we can't rely on the port being 3000.

Fix:
Typically in hosting environments for node application,
there is this environment variable called PORT.

const port = process.env.PORT || 3000
|| means otherwise, and we have that, because if process
doesn't have an env var called port, then port isn't assigned.
